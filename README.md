# Coronavirus analysis
In this homework, we had many zip files containing hundreds of geo-tagged tweets that were published at the onset of the corona virus in october of 2019. For each zip file, we went through the geo tagged tweets and tracked tweets that had certain hashtags and counted the origin country and language of those tweets that included the hashtags that we were looking for. Each day of tweets had an output file that summarized the country and language statistics of the tweets(that included one of the hashtags we were tracking). We reduced all of the country statistics for all of the single day files into one file and we reduced all of the language statistics of all of the single day files into one file. The country and language files were broken down into the statistics for each hashtag. After this, we made it so the country and language files only listed the countries and languages, respectively, with the top 10 number of tweets.
